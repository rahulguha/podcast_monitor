      <div>This is a transcript of an interview between two individuals, one of whom is Bill Hayton, a journalist, and the other is not specified. The conversation appears to be about foreign policy, particularly in relation to the United States under the second Trump administration.

The discussion revolves around several topics:

1. **Ukraine War**: Hayton explains that the war in Ukraine is unique in that it's the first time in quite a long time that "white people are killing white people." He notes that while competition and conflict are inherent characteristics of international relations, what makes Ukraine different is its location in Europe.

2. **Middle East Policy**: The interviewer asks about Hayton's views on Trump's policy in the Middle East, specifically regarding Israel and Gaza, as well as Iran. Hayton explains that the US has been acting as an "offshore balancer" in the region, effectively managing conflicts without direct intervention. He also notes that China's attempts to assert its influence have been exposed as hollow due to lack of success, while Russia's efforts in Ukraine are limited.

3. **Southeast Asia**: Hayton discusses how countries like Malaysia and Indonesia have different responses to US Middle East policy. While Malaysia has a close relationship with Hamas and has been critical of the US support for Israel, Indonesia has maintained its defense relationship with the US but also prioritizes domestic politics when discussing foreign policy issues.

Throughout the conversation, Hayton highlights the complexities and challenges of international relations, emphasizing that global power dynamics are constantly shifting and influenced by local politics.</div>
